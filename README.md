# Slider Game

This "Slider Game" was a project initially started for my Senior Project in high school, which was an open ended research/application project that I did about video game creation. Later, I decided to port the project to JavaScript as an exercize in learning the language and refactoring.

## Setup

The Python version was built with Python2.7 and pygame.

1.  To start, if you don't have it already, install Python2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/). Make sure to check the "add to path" option.

2.  After installation, I would recommend renaming the "python.exe" file that was just created to "python27.exe" to avoid confusion with other versions. I don't recommend using version 2.7 for anything more than running old programs like this.

3.  Open the command line and run the following command:

```
python27 -m pip install pygame
```

4.  Now we are ready to run the game. Either clone it or download the .zip and extract it.

5.  In the command line, navigate to the location of the repository using 

```
cd path-to-folder
```

6.  Finally, execute the game with 

```
python27 SliderGame.py
```

Enjoy!
